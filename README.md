# Easally API documentation

Documentation for the nascent Easally API, in OpenAPI 3.0 format. The current version is available to [view online](https://bump.sh/doc/easally).

## Local development
We use [Speccy](https://speccy.io/) for linting, and previewing the documentation. At time of writing, the Speccy linter complains that the `tags` array is not in alphabetical order. [Speccy is wrong](https://github.com/wework/speccy/issues/366).
